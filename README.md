# Reddit-Corpus-Political-Affiliation-Analyzer
Natural Language Processing Project Dealing with Creating and Training Classifiers and LLM

This project aims to predict a user's political affiliation by analyzing their posts from a social media corpus, specifically sourced from Reddit. It provides hands-on experience in natural language processing (NLP), Python programming, sentiment analysis, and machine learning using sci-kit-learn and fine-tuning the pre-trained POLITICS language models from Hugging Face.

Features:
Preprocessing of social media corpus data
Design and implementation of feature extraction
Utilization of various machine learning algorithms for classification
Fine-tuning of the POLITICS language model for neural classification
Comparative analysis between feature-based and neural classifiers
Requirements:
Python 3.10.13 
Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, transformers (for fine-tuning POLITICS), nltk
