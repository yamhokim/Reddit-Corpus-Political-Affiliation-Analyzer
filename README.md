# Reddit-Corpus-Political-Affiliation-Analyzer
Natural Language Processing Project Dealing with Creating and Training Classifiers and LLM

This project aims to predict a user's political affiliation by analyzing their posts from a social media corpus, specifically sourced from Reddit. It provides hands-on experience in natural language processing (NLP), Python programming, sentiment analysis, and machine learning using sci-kit-learn and fine-tuning the pre-trained POLITICS language models from Hugging Face.

# Features:
- Preprocessing of social media corpus data
- Design and implementation of feature extraction
- Utilization of various machine learning algorithms for classification
- Fine-tuning of the POLITICS language model for neural classification
- Comparative analysis between feature-based and neural classifiers

# Requirements:
- Python 3.10.13

# Libraries:
- sci-kit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- transformers (for fine-tuning POLITICS)
- nltk

# Usage:
1. **Create a conda environment compatible with Python 3.10.13:**
    ```bash
    conda create -n political_affiliation python=3.10.13
    ```

2. **Activate the conda environment:**
    ```bash
    conda activate political_affiliation
    ```

3. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/political-affiliation-prediction.git
    ```

4. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd political-affiliation-prediction
    ```
